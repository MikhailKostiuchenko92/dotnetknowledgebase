## Short Answer

On-Stack Replacement lets the runtime upgrade a method from quick Tier 0 code to optimized Tier 1 code while the method is still executing. It exists because a long-running loop may enter cold code once and then stay there for a long time, never giving tiered compilation a chance to re-enter the method in optimized form. In .NET 7 and later, OSR is enabled by default as part of the QuickJitForLoops story, using patchpoints at loop back-edges to trigger a re-JIT and transfer execution into the new frame.

## Detailed Explanation

### The Problem: Tiered Compilation Alone Is Not Enough

Tiered compilation normally starts with fast-to-produce Tier 0 code, then recompiles hot methods into higher-quality Tier 1 code after call counting shows the method is important. That works well when the method returns frequently, because the next call can enter the optimized version.

But imagine a method that is called once and then spends seconds inside a hot loop. Without OSR, that method might remain in minimally optimized Tier 0 code for the entire loop, even though it is clearly hot. The runtime knows the method is important, but there is no natural method-entry point to switch code versions.

### The Core Idea Behind OSR

OSR solves that problem by placing a special check, often described as a patchpoint, at selected loop back-edges. Each time execution reaches that back-edge, the runtime can ask a question: “Has this method become hot enough that we should produce Tier 1 code now?”

If the threshold is not met, execution continues in Tier 0. If the threshold is met, the runtime triggers a re-JIT of the method and creates an optimized Tier 1 version. Then it transfers execution from the currently running Tier 0 frame into the corresponding point in Tier 1 code.

That transfer is the important part: OSR is not just recompilation, it is recompilation plus state mapping of the active method frame.

### What the Runtime Has to Preserve

For OSR to work, the JIT must know how local variables, loop counters, and evaluation state in the running Tier 0 frame correspond to the new Tier 1 frame. That is why OSR is an advanced JIT feature rather than a simple “jump to new code” trick.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1 | Method starts in Tier 0 for low startup cost |
| 2 | Loop back-edge executes repeatedly |
| 3 | Patchpoint checks whether the method is now hot |
| 4 | JIT emits Tier 1 code in the background/on demand |
| 5 | Runtime maps frame state and resumes in optimized code |

### .NET 7+ Behavior

OSR became a mainstream runtime feature in .NET 7 as part of the improved tiered compilation pipeline. With QuickJitForLoops enabled by default in .NET 7+, methods containing loops can start quickly and still transition into better code while the loop is live.

This complements, rather than replaces, [tiered-compilation.md](./tiered-compilation.md). Tiered compilation decides *when* a method deserves better code; OSR gives the runtime a way to apply that decision even when the method has not returned yet.

> Warning: OSR helps hot, long-running loops. It does not magically optimize short-lived methods that finish before profiling data is meaningful.

### Observing OSR in Practice

You can often observe OSR by running a tight benchmark with JIT diagnostics enabled. `DOTNET_JitDisasm` lets you inspect the generated assembly, and when combined with tiered compilation settings you can sometimes see both the quick entry version and the optimized OSR target version being emitted.

For experimentation, developers commonly reduce delays or make warm-up aggressive so tiering decisions happen sooner. A useful mental model is: R2R or Tier 0 gets you executing quickly, and OSR prevents long loops from being trapped in that low-optimization state forever.

## Code Example

```csharp
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

namespace RuntimeSamples.OnStackReplacement;

internal static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        // Try running with:
        // DOTNET_TieredCompilation=1
        // DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1
        // DOTNET_JitDisasm=Program:HotLoop
        Console.WriteLine(HotLoop(50_000_000));
    }

    [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] // Easier to inspect in disassembly.
    private static long HotLoop(int iterations)
    {
        long sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++)
        {
            // A loop that runs long enough to make OSR worthwhile.
            sum += (i * 13L) ^ (i >> 2);
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```

## Common Follow-up Questions

- How does OSR relate to Tier 0 and Tier 1 compilation?
- What is a patchpoint in the context of OSR?
- Why does OSR primarily target loops rather than arbitrary points in a method?
- How can you inspect OSR behavior with JIT disassembly tools?
- What would happen to a one-call long-running method without OSR?

## Common Mistakes / Pitfalls

- Explaining OSR as “background recompilation” only; the hard part is switching the active stack frame safely.
- Assuming OSR replaces tiered compilation; it is a complement to it.
- Expecting OSR benefits on short methods that never stay hot long enough.
- Forgetting that loop back-edges are the trigger points where the runtime can safely consider promotion.
- Trying to reason about OSR from a single cold execution without enabling or observing JIT diagnostics.
